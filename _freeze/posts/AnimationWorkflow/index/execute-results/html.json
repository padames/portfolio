For those times, generating animations can be just what you need. They can also become visualization aids during data exploration or a means to explain observations to yourself and others.\n\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of use cases, however, they are pretty common and their impact can be high. The deliverable is an embedded moving graph for your presentation or web content. After all, if an image is worth a thousand words then an animation should be worth a bit more.\n\nThis workflow is the basis to create the visualizations used in this LinkedIn post @Padames:wager2021\n\n![Animation from the LinkedIn post referred to by @Padames:wager2021](thumbnail.gif)\n\nIn that post this animation was created using a simple but effective workflow.\n\n1.  Run a numerical model using simulated input\n2.  The output of each run is used to construct a plot.\n3.  Each plot is saved to a PNG file.\n4.  Then a GIF file is constructed with all the jpeg files.\n\nTo illustrate this workflow we will use simulation. Other use cases may be sensor data or any observed data.\n\n### Prepare the input data\n\nWhen applying this algorithm to a simulation, the input in Step 1 above usually comes from a pseudo random number generator in your language of choice. In this case I used the following R code to generate the data before constructing the plots and the animation. The code computes the cumulative profit or loss from repeatedly playing the same wager for a very long time. Eventually the expected result should tend to zero for either wager 3 or 4.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .numberLines}\nlibrary(lattice)\n\nnumsimulations = 20000\nnumframes = 30\n  \nset.seed(1892)\ndievalues = seq(1,6)\n\nfor (i in 1:numframes){\n  \n  die3 = sample(dievalues, numsimulations, replace=T)\n  die4 = sample(dievalues, numsimulations, replace=T)\n  \n  profit3 = 300*( die3>3 ) - 300*( die3<=3 )\n  profit4 = 150*( die4>2 ) - 300*( die4<=2 )\n  \n  runningprofit3 = cumsum(profit3) / seq(1, numsimulations)\n  runningprofit4 = cumsum(profit4) / seq(1, numsimulations)\n  \n  df3 <- data.frame(wager=rep(3,length(runningprofit3)), runningprofit=runningprofit3, tries=seq(1,numsimulations))\n  df4 <- data.frame(wager=rep(4,length(runningprofit4)), runningprofit=runningprofit4, tries=seq(1,numsimulations))\n  df <- rbind(df3, df4)\n  \n  # more code follows here to generate the plots and the PNG files\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nLine **3** sets the number of simulation points to 20,000 so we get sharp plots. Line **5** sets the number of frames that the animation will have. Line **6** defines a fixed value for reproducible results from the pseudo random number generator used by the `sample` function that will be used in lines 11 and 12. Line **7** defines the 6 possible results of rolling a single die. Line **9** starts a loop to generate the frames of the animation. In lines **11** and **12** two vectors of 20,000 elements are created, each one simulates one roll of a fair die. The code in lines **14** and **15** create the two vectors of 20,000 elements, each represents the profit resulting from rolling the die once. Each throw is an independent event, thus their individual profit can be computed with the input vectors `die3` and `die4`.\\\nLines **17** and **18** compute the cumulative profit or loss resulting from sequentially realizing the 20,000 wagers sequentially.\n\nThe following code inspects some of the vectors generated above for each frame. R is a natively vectorized language, therefore no special libraries are necessary. The library import statement in line **1** is for plot generation in a latter step.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlength(runningprofit3)\n#> [1] 20000\n\nhead(runningprofit3)\n#> [1] -300    0 -100    0   60  100\ntail(runningprofit3)\n#> [1] -2.925731 -2.910582 -2.895434 -2.880288 -2.895145 -2.880000\nhead(runningprofit4)\n#> [1] -300.0  -75.0    0.0   37.5   60.0   75.0\ntail(runningprofit4)\n#> [1] -1.822956 -1.815363 -1.830275 -1.845185 -1.860093 -1.852500\n```\n:::\n\n\nOne can see how the initial profit or loss can be large, however the net value tends to be near zero after many repetitions.\n\n### Construct plots with the output data\n\nThe graphic package Trellis is designed to work on data presented in the so-called long format. The idea is that the dataframe with all the data has a column representing a categorical variable representing the subgroup the data belongs to. This is a fundamental idea behind this package. This plotting of many subgroups in a grid-like pattern is what is called faceting in ggplot2 terms.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .numberLines}\n  df3 <- data.frame(wager=rep(3,length(runningprofit3)), runningprofit=runningprofit3, tries=seq(1,numsimulations))\n  df4 <- data.frame(wager=rep(4,length(runningprofit4)), runningprofit=runningprofit4, tries=seq(1,numsimulations))\n  df <- rbind(df3, df4)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn lines **1** and **2** above, separate data frames each of 20,000 rows are created. In line **3** they are stacked vertically together to form a single data structure with 40,000 rows.\n\nThe following calls to the first and last three lines of the dataframe illustrate the long format of the data. The column wager represent the subgroup each row belongs to: wager 3 or 4.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(df, n = 3)\n#>   wager runningprofit tries\n#> 1     3          -300     1\n#> 2     3             0     2\n#> 3     3          -100     3\ntail(df, n = 3)\n#>       wager runningprofit tries\n#> 39998     4     -1.845185 19998\n#> 39999     4     -1.860093 19999\n#> 40000     4     -1.852500 20000\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe are ready to plot using the lattice plotting package.\nThe following is the function that creates and returns such a lattice plot object.\nIt receives two arguments, the dataframe in long form and a list of arguments to configure the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a lattice xy plot object in memory ------------------------------------------------\n# Purpose:        to construct a valid lattice log_x-y plot of one or more series \n# Description:    The argument `the_data_frame` is in long form, where each row has data\n#                 for a sub-group.

Line \\*\\* 3\\*\\* creates the arguments expected by the function as one list.\nThe elements of the list are named so their order does not matter.\nOnly the subgroup_descriptions can be NULL.\nTheir function is explained by their name.\nIn line **11** the lattice plot is created in memory and returned immediately to be assigned to the variable `pp`.\nThe function `xyplot` comes from the package `lattice`.\nLine **14** passes the lattice object `pp` to the function `print` to create the PNG file using the name convention given in line **1**.\nMultiple calls to print will create new PNG files adding one each timne to the numeric value represented by the `%02d` that is part of the file name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .numberLines}\npng(file=\"simwager%02d.png\", width=600, height=400)\n\nargs_to_plot <- list( subgroup_variable = 'wager',\n                      subgroup_descriptions = c(\"Wager3 = 3(die>3) - 3(die<=3)\",\n                        \"Wager 4 = 1.5(die>2) - 3(die<=2)\"),\n                      text_labels_for_plot = list(title=\"Running profits from two different wagers\",\n                             x_label=\"Number of tries\",\n                             y_label=\"Cummulative profit\"),\n                      min_max_y_to_plot = c(-350, 350))\n\npp <- create_xyplot(df, \n                    args_to_plot)\n\nprint(pp)\n\ndev.off()\n#> png \n#>   2\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis code creates a file called `simwager01.png` in the current working directory for the R session, as shown below.\n\n![Plot produced by the previous code chunk in the current working directory.](simwager01.png)\n\nIf this sequence of calls are part of an iteration loop, several PNG files will be created, each with an monotonically increased serial number as part of its name.\nFor an explanation of how it works see [the r-documentation for the function `png`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.4.1/topics/png)\n\nI left some details out of the code shown at the beginning of this post because it would have been a distraction then.\nWe must create a directory called animations from the project root path and then make it the current working directory as the first action in the script.\nBy doing this all the file actions occur in the same folder.\nThat is, the PNG files required for one animation are first created and then deleted after they are used in the same directory where the animated GIF file is created. \n\n\nThe following code accomplishes creating and changing into this directory.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\npacman::p_load(\"here\")\n\nsuppressWarnings(my_proj_path <- here())\n\nif (!file.exists(file.path(my_proj_path,\"animations\"))) {\n  dir.create(file.path(my_proj_path, \"animations\"))\n}\nsetwd(file.path(my_proj_path, \"animations\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Creating the GIF animated file\n\nWhat we have up to this point is a directory with PNG files. \nThe implicit assumption is that the order each PNG file is to be used to create the animation is implicit in its name.\nI will use a program to render an animated file in GIF format from the PNG files using the  command line.\nThe renderer used is [`convert`](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) from the package ImageMagik, publicly available as binaries for [download](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) for Linux, Mac and Windows, this example was run on Ubuntu Linux 24.04, version ImageMagick 6.9.12-98 Q16 x86_64 18038.\n\nTo call `convert` we make an operating system call from the R script.\nThe arguments assume that all PNG files in the current directory are meant to be part of the GIF output.\nThe order of the frames for the animation come from the digits included in the file names using the `%02d` in the call to the function `png`. \nFinally the PNG files are deleted from the folder.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsystem(\"/usr/bin/convert -delay 40 *.png wager_comp_sim.gif\")\n\nfile.remove(list.files(pattern=\".png\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe delay argument sets the time pause between frames in centiseconds. \nThis makes the frame rate approximately 2.5 frames per second.\n\nThe package [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/), @PederAndRobin:2024, works under the same workflow explained here but it gives the flexibility to choose renderer and the file format of the final animation.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe basic workflow for the creation of a GIF animated file has been presented with luxury of detail. One has to consider four basic steps: organize the data whereas it is observed or simulated. Then create a meaningful plot that adresses the research question. Then create multiple PNG files and finally create the GIF file from the intermediary PNG files.\n\nThe complete code for this example can be found in the GitHub repo: [wagers](https://github.com/padames/wagers)\n\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
