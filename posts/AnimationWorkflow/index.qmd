## Why doing this?

Do you ever feel like a plain graph is not sufficient to explain some trend in your data or the solution of a mathematical model? For those times, generating animations can be just what you need. They can also become visualization aids during data exploration or a means to explain to yourself and others observed or simulated results.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of use cases, however, they are pretty common and their impact can be high. The deliverable is an embedded moving graph for your presentation or web content. After all, if an image is worth a thousand words then an animation should be worth a bit more.

This workflow is the basis to create the visualizations used in this LinkedIn post @Padames:wager2021
