This is the home for a few short posts and presentations made throughout the years. Most are related to subjects of personal interest like data modeling and visualization. I am also very fond of Machine Learning, High-Performance computing, and computer languages in general.

There is a license attribution on each posting. Everything here is in the Public Domain or has a very permissive license due to its simple nature. In general most endeavors thrive when we collaborate and share our failures as much as our successes. This is specially true given the observation that only a few out of the many potential paths lead to a desired goal.
