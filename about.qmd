This is a personal blog with entries reflecting my professional interests in computer languages and data analysis and visualization.

Most of my professional experience has been developing Engineering applications using Matlab for modelling and C++ for library implementation. 
I like Python in spite of relying on indentation alone for scoping blocks of code. Strongly typed and more declarative than procedural languages win the day for me.
I have way too many books on Haskell, a language that has formed me in many ways. I love functional programming and I am so glad C++ and Python have embraced it. 

In the last 5 years, after completing a Master of Engineering in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary I have had the chance to designing and use relational and document (also called noSQL) databases for system development. 

I am pretty good at Linux bash programming as some of my colleagues at work know too well.
However I am fonder of more Lispy languages like R when it comes to scripting. 
As far as natively compiled languages I recently I took up Rust after realizing how much of an improvement it is over C and C++ in terms of memory safety and overall speed of development.

I will write more on this Rust journey because I think this is technology that can change the way we build software infrastructure.
